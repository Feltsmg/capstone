<p>
Super Saiyan 2 (超サイヤ人 ツー, Sūpā Saiya-jin Tsū) is the direct successor to the first Super Saiyan 
transformation. It is very similar to the original form in appearance and attainment; however, the power 
output is far greater, as speed, strength, and energy output all drastically increase. Gohan is the first
person to attain the form in the manga and the anime, and he uses it while fighting against Cell in the 
Cell Games. Goku, Vegeta and Future Trunks soon follow, with Goku training to achieve it in the Other 
World and both Vegeta and Future Trunks training on Earth.
