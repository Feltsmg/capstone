The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the universe from the earliest known 
periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution.[5][6][7] The model accounts for the fact that the 
universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state,[8][9] and offers a comprehensive 
explanation for a broad range of phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic 
microwave background, large scale structure and Hubble's Law.[10] If the known laws of physics are 
extrapolated beyond where they have been verified, there is a singularity. Some estimates place this 
moment at approximately 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe.[11] 
After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic 
particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through 
gravity to form stars and galaxies.
